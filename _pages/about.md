Hello! My name is Ashwin Kolla. I am an undergraduate student at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I will be using this website as a way to share some of the projects that I have done. This includes anything from some cool class projects that I have done to some projects involving AI that I have been constructing recently.

I am looking forward to seeing how this page progresses!
